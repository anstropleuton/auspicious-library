# Auspicious Library usage examples
I have compiled together *some* examples that might get you started with using my library. I have not covered everything though, because you can just check out https://anstropleuton.github.io/auspicious-library for all the stuff that.

This file is just an index for the examples, but a note for all you reading: **Check [sm/to_string.cpp](sm/to_string.cpp) example before other examples.** This example contains info on how to use `sm::to_string` which is used in many other examples for ease.

## CU
- [cu/boundless_containers.cpp](cu/boundless_containers.cpp): How to use `cu::boundless_access` and boundless containers.

## SM

## AEC

## AP

## FU
